  or `clang -o server ./server.c` depending on the compiler you want to use/have installed.
- Run: `./server`
- Visit: [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)
- Then: üëè for yourself, you just ran the rohanasan's example!
- You can host the example folder as well!!! Use the docker file,
  It has all the correct configuration!

# How to use in your project?
- Open terminal inside the parent folder where you would like to create the folder of your project

```sh
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohanasan/rohanasan_c/main/rohanasan_maker.py -o rohanasan_maker.py
python3 ./rohanasan_maker.py
rm ./rohanasan_maker.py
```
- Now, you `cd` into the folder created my the rohanasan project maker software.
- then run:
- `make release run` to run your project!
- Enjoy using Rohanasan!

## Basic hello world looks like this:
```c
#include "./include/rohanasan.h"

const char* myhandle(struct request req)
{
    return send_http_response(default_html_header,
        "<h1>Hello from Rohanasan!</h1>");
}

int main()
{
    init(8080);
    serve(myhandle);
    return 0;
